# DistributedSystemsCollection
A compendium of a lot of exercises that I develop for my distributed systems course in the university, ranging from sockets, multithreading, synchronized threads, multicast, memory hierarchy, algorithms against mutual exclusion; to Java RMI, JSON (GSON specifically) and Web Services in REST. Made mostly with Java and applied in Microsoft Azure.
