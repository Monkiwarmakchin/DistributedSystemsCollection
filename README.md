# DistributedSystemsCollection
A compendium of a lot of exercises I developed for my distributed systems course in college, ranging from sockets, multithreading, synchronized threads, multicast, memory hierarchy, algorithms against mutual exclusion; to Java RMI, JSON (GSON specifically) and Web Services in REST. Made mostly with Java and applied in Microsoft Azure.

Every folder has its own README.md to explain itself.
